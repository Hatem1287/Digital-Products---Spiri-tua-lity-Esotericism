<h4>Step 1: Cultivating Self-Awareness</h4>

<h4>Step 5: Aligning with Purpose and Passion</h4>
<p>Discovering and living your soul’s purpose is a defining milestone on this secret path. When your daily actions align with your deepest passions and values, your spirit feels nourished and vibrant. This alignment translates into fulfillment and a sense of meaningful existence.</p>
